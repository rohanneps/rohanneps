The crossguard has the traditional fouled anchor center blocks and acanthus leaf quillon arms. The button ends show modest hand wear but retain most of the original detailing.
<p>The grip of this dagger is in excellent condition. It is constructed of carved wood with a covering of celluloid. This celluloid has toned to a pleasing off-white color and is wrapped with twisted brass wire.</p>
<p>The scabbard is the lightning bolt type. It is completely free of dents and has fine, raised oak leaf carrying bands. These WKC bands are larger than most and have serrated eyelets. Some of the serrations on these eyelets have traces of wear but it is not bad. The scabbard is deeply stamped with palmettes over and under the bands. The lower portion features a design of ermine feet and acanthus leaves. The throat is retained by a pair of dome head brass screws.</p>

Due to an unforeseen disability I have accumulated more than 100 pieces of Tahar's work and decided to sell them along with my other collections. I chose Arizona Custom Knives because of the job Julie and Chris have done with more than 200 knives I have consigned with them. <br><br>In 2009, I sent Tahar to the knife show in New York where his work was displayed for the first time. It was here that Master Smith Jay Hendrickson stopped at his table, admired his work, and wrote a letter addressing the quality of Tahar's damascus and knives. In 2011, Wm. C. Johnson was so impressed with Tahar's damascus on display in Las Vegas that he purchased two billets to use in his own work.

"177122","HEFT 12 CHOP - First Run Limited Edition of 200","$395.00","<p>From the DPx Gear Website:<br><br>""After decades in the jungles of Asia, Africa, North America and other remote places, I have always wanted something between a machete and a rugged survival knife,&rdquo;says DPx Gear founder Robert Young Pelton. &ldquo;The CHOP is a twelve inch piece of razor sharp Sleipner steel that makes short work of building camp, cooking, and even self defense.&rdquo;The key to the CHOP&rsquo;s unique patented design is not just the use of the same exotic steel used in the commercial meat processing industry but also the ergonomics. The shape of the knife is unique. A deeply ergonomic handle with rounded full tang flows into a front-heavy axe-like tip. There are also twelve inches of perfectly straight, sword grind Sleipner steel to perform precision work;a flat, thick spine for pounding;a relief area to balance the knife;and a two inch tip with a thicker grind for splitting wood and a thick point for ground work.&nbsp;There are also two clever depressions at the front and back of the spine for batoning through timber.</p>
<p>The overall look is reminiscent of the Asian parang;designs that Pelton used for years on expeditions through the island of Borneo. The crude but flexible car spring blades had to be backed up with a heavy bush knife and small axe for splitting wood that doubled the weight of one&rsquo;s gear. The DPx Gear CHOP 12 is the perfect middle ground between a hatchet, machete and heavy bush knife. Paired with a light, tough, skinning knife like the DPx HEST Original it becomes the perfect outdoor combination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This breakthrough blade has been shaped, trimmed and tweaked for the heavy work demanded by extreme environments,&rdquo;notes Pelton who spends long periods of time using and testing his prototypes in hard places like Somalia, Afghanistan, Burma, South Sudan, and other areas where he works as a war journalist, explorer and author. &ldquo;The CHOP is a spare-no-expense survival blade that can be used to cut down a twelve inch tree or even for fine tasks like shaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The DPx HEFT 12 CHOP is made in Italy by LionSTEEL and features stonewashed Sleipner stainless steel, ergonomic black Micarta scales and a KYDEX expedition sheath made in the USA. <br><br>.218"" blade stock and 2.447"" blade depth, full tang construction.

I chose Arizona Custom Knives because of the job Julie and Chris have done with more than 200 knives I have consigned with them. <br><br>In 2009, I sent Tahar to the knife show in New York where his work was displayed for the first time. It was here that Master Smith Jay Hendrickson stopped at his table, admired his work, and wrote a letter addressing the quality of Tahar's damascus and knives. In 2011, Wm. C. Johnson was so impressed with Tahar's damascus on display in Las Vegas that he purchased two billets to use in his own work.

Using this blade form is one superb method of making an edge thick without losing of its sharpness. This is a knife of preeminent sharpness. You can enjoy its strong cutting capabilities for a long time. Even if used for rigorous cutting, the blade will not bite thanks to its convex shape. Other knives often will bite, and may nick if it is pulled out suddenly at that time. This knife scratches the plate of china. Please do not use it to cut food on the plate.""

One major benefit is that you can largely bring back your watch in the original condition by using a Cape Cod cloth. <br> <br> Despite the name and style of the watch, it's remarkably comfortable due to the case shape and the awesome and supply Italian leather strap (with a matching bronze buckle).

It proudly retains all the distinguishing features of its bigger brother, but in a smaller, more pocket-friendly format.<br><br>The blade of the Lil&rsquo;LionSpy is ground from premium Elmax steel&mdash;a third-generation powdered metallurgy steel from Austria&rsquo;s B&ouml;hler-Uddeholm. Known for its high carbon and chromium contents and extra-fine grain structure, Elmax provides extreme edge holding and corrosion resistance. The blade is purposely thick for strength, but features a high flat grind and a pronounced &ldquo;belly&rdquo;for superior cutting performance.<br><br>The Lil&rsquo;LionSpy&rsquo;s two-piece handle construction consists of a black G-10 scale and a titanium scale that serves as the basis of the knife&rsquo;s stout Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism. Both scales are CNC machined with a series of textured grooves to ensure a positive grip and are joined by an open-backed design that reduces weight and simplifies cleaning. A compact pocket clip attached to the titanium scale supports right-side, tip-up orientation for convenient carry and easy access.<br><br>To ensure superior lock reliability, the Lil&rsquo;LionSpy&rsquo;s advanced R.I.L. mechanism features a hardened steel insert and LionSteel&rsquo;s patented RotoBlock device. This titanium disk serves as an overtravel stop for the lock bar. When the blade is opened, turning the RotoBlock clockwise wedges the lock bar in place, preventing unintentional release of the lock and providing outstanding stability during hard-use cutting chores. Rotating the RotoBlock counterclockwise frees the lock bar and allows it to be operated to close the knife. <br><br>Includes original zippered case and paperwork.

<p>The guard maintains the hand in firm control over the blade while creating a block, effectively stopping fingers from sliding forward and connecting with the sharp edge. And it&rsquo;s surprisingly comfortable in any sized hand- adult man, woman or juvenile. Position of the guard in the G-10 handle leaves little room for a locking mechanism and a Spyderco Compression Lock is added for its compact components and impressive strength.</p>

One version has a gut hook (double beveled and sharpened on both sides of the inside radius) positioned at the blade&rsquo;s tip that vanishes fully into the contours of the handle when the knife folds closed. The second Impala is snubbed-nosed, muscled thick at the tip, and textured with furrows atop the tip&rsquo;s spine and again behind the round hole. The texture creates a positioning point for the index finger focusing control over intricate cuts or caping. Both have blades 3 11/16&rdquo;(94mm) long of VG-10 high carbon stainless steel that lock open with a Walker linerlock. Positioned for tip-down pocket carry, the clothing clip sits nested in a shallow crater milled out of the G-10 handle. The crater creates a lower profile for comfortable use.

In some areas the depth of the water is still unknown. There are instances of fisherman pulling out catfish the size of a school bus. Along this river you run across locals. Most of them carry guns but ALL of them carry a good knife because the place they live in is unforgiving. All this to tell you why we came up with our survival knife. First of all, we needed something very strong, hence full tang, 1/4"" thick. We also needed something that could be used as a hatchet. That is why we have a chunk cut out of the spine of the blade. It brings the weight of the knife forward. It also provides a striking surface and, if you want to use your knife in a defensive manner, it offers great trapping qualities in the reverse grip.""","Szabo, Laci","","","","/17872.jpg","5.75""","11.0""","","","","","",""

You can enjoy its strong cutting capabilities for a long time. Even if used for rigorous cutting, the blade will not bite thanks to its convex shape. Other knives often will bite, and may nick if it is pulled out suddenly at that time. This knife scratches the plate of china. Please do not use it to cut food on the plate.""

<p>""The blade is convex on both sides in the tradition of the highly praised Japanese sword. This shape is both sharp and strong, and can still slice paper even after the 1,000 of hemp rope cuts. Using this blade form is one superb method of making an edge thick without losing of its sharpness. This is a knife of preeminent sharpness. You can enjoy its strong cutting capabilities for a long time. Even if used for rigorous cutting, the blade will not bite thanks to its convex shape. Other knives often will bite, and may nick if it is pulled out suddenly at that time. This knife scratches the plate of china. Please do not use it to cut food on the plate.""

One member of the RMJ team was attempting to plan a trip through several different countries in Africa over several weeks and wanted a hawk which would not stick out to the average person, but still had tremendous capability with whatever task is thrown at it.</p>
<p>The tomahawk needed to be lightweight and concealable, but with the abilities to chop through mild brush, breach different items, and even used for self defense if necessary. &nbsp;</p>

An archaeological excavation at the site yielded the remnants of a pier, and this extraordinary sword. <br> <br> It was still in its scabbard and remarkably intact when it was awakened from its sleep in the muddy clay of the medieval shoreline (missing only part of one arm of the cross-guard, a section of the point and the organic portions of the grip). The original sword is now on display at the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, Sweden. <br></span></span>
<p align=""left""><span style=""color: #666666;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: medium;"">The sword is a stunning eye-catcher and presented many interesting challenges during the process of reconstruction. It was obviously made by a master of the craft and combines awesome cleaving power with agility and speed. <br> <br> Despite its hefty weight it is smooth and responsive in handling. Its blade, tang, cross and pommel were skillfully forged with a good eye for beautiful proportions and a deep understanding of the dynamic qualities of a broad slashing sword of such imposing dimensions. A distinguishing feature is how the distal taper is designed to give support and stiffness to the thin cutting section of the blade. </span></p>

Weapons like these were effectively wielded from horseback and were popular during the later part of the 13th C and the first half of the 14th C. </span></p>
<p align=""left""><span style=""color: #666666;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: medium;"">The sword made in the workshops of Albion is a direct result of a project for the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. Swordsmith Peter Johnsson was commissioned to forge an exact reconstruction that was to be exhibited alongside the original. <br> <br> The knowledge gained during this project is now resulting in a faithful and highly realistic reconstruction made by the skilled artisans of Albion. No effort is spared to make the swords true to the original not only in dimensions but also in performance and aesthetic details. </span></p>
<p align=""left""><span style=""color: #666666;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: medium;"">The blades are hand-ground and finished to a high satin finish. Each blade is individually heat treated in Albion's Shop for maximum flexibility and cutting performance.

The Lambda Brass is an excercise in both.&nbsp;<span class=""highlight-text"">The brass used in the ring&nbsp;</span>is predominantely a copper alloy, and heavier than anything but much more exotic metals. Brass cuts easily, which means it machines VERY consistently. Tougher materials wear the tools faster which leads to quicker changes in part dimension and ""out of tolerance"" conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Included in this auction is the BetaC titanium knife, updated 2<sup>nd</sup> generation sheath, rubber snubber, ballistic nylon strap and original box. No rubber leg straps included.</p>
<p>Here is what Homer Brett wrote about this &ldquo;updated&rdquo;knife in Waffen Digest 1999&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Updated MPK</em></strong><em>&nbsp;--- While Mission Knives and then Mission Knives &amp;Tools, were developing the series of knives covered in this article, they were also experimenting with various prototype designs based on the U.S. Navy's MPK. This work was done in response to a variety of requests and suggestions from both the Navy and the Marine Corps, as well as other U.S. military units.</em></p>
<p><em>Of special historical note, are the standardized blade markings on the various MPK ricassos. The first Navy Seal contract specified sterile (unmarked) blades, however after some serious thought the navy later revised its policy, and decided that it is better to purchase ""marked"" knives as they will not attract quite&nbsp;as much unwanted attention. The first MPKs with ""Mission"" markings were laser engraved on the knives' left ricassos with:</em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>MPK&nbsp;<br> MISSION KNIVES</strong></p>
<p><em>A short time later, this identical marking was permanently moved over to the MPK's&nbsp;right ricasso. When Mission Knives became Mission Knives &amp;Tools, the blade marking was retained on the right ricasso, but was changed to:</em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>MPK&nbsp;<br> MISSION</strong></p>
<p><em>and this marking is now used on all ""Mission"" designs, but in varying forms.</em></p>
<p><em>The MPK's current production scabbard has been redesigned to incorporate additional features requested by the Navy Seal Teams, and based on Mission's own field testing. Two sets of integral side slots are now part of the scabbard, in order to allow the Seals to attach flares or other items of equipment to the exterior face of the scabbard.</em></p>
<p><em>The rubber pull tab, of the hilt securing O-ring at the top of the scabbard has been redesigned to allow the user to get a better grip on it. This design change was compliments of the U. S. Marine Corps, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company, based at Camp Pendleton. The tip of web cross strap which secures the knife's hilt in the scabbard, has been lengthened to give the user more webbing to grasp on to, in order to more easily open the securing snap, especially when the user's hand is wet, cold or slippery.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, it was found that the front corners of the scabbard's throat were so squared as to be almost sharp. Their abrasive effect was particularly noticeable when they scraped against the arms of swimmers who had been in water for a lengthy period of time (an experience shared by the author after parachuting into Lake Balaton with the Hungarian Airborne forces, in 1996). With this obvious proof, the scabbard mold was modified so that the corners of the scabbard are now much more rounded and less abrasive.</em></p>","Mission Knives","","","","/MPK_179571_1.jpg","7.0""","12.0""","9.1 oz","Previously Owned","Titanium","Has Serrations, Clip Point","",""

"179760","C163TIP Pingo Ti","$125.00","A collaborative effort of Danish knifemakers Jens Anso and Jesper Voxnaes, the Pingo was specifically designed to conform to the knife laws of Denmark, which prohibit both lock-blade folding knives and all forms of one-hand-opening knives.<br><br>The heart of the Pingo is its distinctive sheepfoot blade, which is ground from Austrian Bohler-Uddeholm&rsquo;s Elmax steel. Elmax boasts high carbon and chromium contents and an extra-fine grain structure that provide extreme edge holding and corrosion resistance. The blade is designed to meet Danish legal length limits while still providing a very functional and versatile cutting tool. Its Trademark Round Hole clearly identifies it as a Spyderco knife and provides a handy purchase for two-handed opening, but the hole is purposely small to prevent one-handed blade-opening methods. Similarly, its stout notched-joint mechanism is powered by a strong spring that helps hold the blade securely in the open and closed positions, supporting its safe use as a cutting tool while precluding one-handed opening.<br><br>The Pingo features solid Titanium handles with a color anodized ""wraparound"" bug logo which really makes the knife pop! A reversible deep-pocket wire clip provides both left and right-side tip-up carry, keeping the knife accessible for immediate use while blending unobtrusively with virtually any color of clothing.<br><br>Although designed to meet the unique needs of the Danish knife community, the Pingo&rsquo;s versatile design and socially friendly demeanor make it a perfect choice for knife users everywhere. It not only transcends the limits of the traditional non-locking pocketknife, but also redefines Spyderco&rsquo;s own definition of a SLIPIT because of its purposeful two-hand-opening design.

The pocket clip positions the folder to carry right-handed tip-up. A small portion of steel removed from the locking lever offers additional lock safety and is called a David Boye Dent.

"180038","C150GP Junior Pocket Knife","$190.00","<p>The concept of the Junior folder comes from Romanian Technical Manager Alexandru Diaconescu.

The request brought-up normal parental questions and concerns regarding knife safety and usability motivating Dionescu to create a folder with a prominent guard behind the blade&rsquo;s sharpened edge.</p>
<p>The guard maintains the hand in firm control over the blade while creating a block, effectively stopping fingers from sliding forward and connecting with the sharp edge. And it&rsquo;s surprisingly comfortable in any sized hand- adult man, woman or juvenile. Position of the guard in the G-10 handle leaves little room for a locking mechanism and a Spyderco Compression Lock is added for its compact components and impressive strength.</p>
<p>Screw-together construction, an oversized lanyard hole and a deep pocket left- or right-handed tip-up wire clip further complement the handle.

"180163","TI-Lock","$500.00","""In Chris&rsquo;s opinion, Grant and Gavin Hawk are the most innovative design team in the industry. In early 2010, the Hawks showed Chris the concept of a new locking mechanism&mdash;one that Chris felt he could engineer and Chris Reeve Knives could manufacture. It has been a lack of capacity not a lack of desire that has precluded Chris Reeve Knives from producing Hawk Designs thus far. It is an honor to present the Ti-Lock. The Ti-Lock mechanism was originally conceived as a means to isolate the lock from the body of the knife, in order to allow more design freedom for handle and frame. Completely ambidextrious, the Ti-Lock allows equal left and right hand use. The Ti-Lock is not an exercise in ultimate lock strength;it is an exercise in mechanical innovation and an illustration of a passion shared by Grant, Gavin and Chris. This passion is also shared by many of our customers&mdash;those who buy our knives in appreciation of the design, quality and precision put into our product.""<br><br>Excellent condition, knife shows no signs of use or carry.

"180281","TI-Lock - Blue Steam","$475.00","""In Chris&rsquo;s opinion, Grant and Gavin Hawk are the most innovative design team in the industry. In early 2010, the Hawks showed Chris the concept of a new locking mechanism&mdash;one that Chris felt he could engineer and Chris Reeve Knives could manufacture. It has been a lack of capacity not a lack of desire that has precluded Chris Reeve Knives from producing Hawk Designs thus far. It is an honor to present the Ti-Lock. The Ti-Lock mechanism was originally conceived as a means to isolate the lock from the body of the knife, in order to allow more design freedom for handle and frame. Completely ambidextrious, the Ti-Lock allows equal left and right hand use. The Ti-Lock is not an exercise in ultimate lock strength;it is an exercise in mechanical innovation and an illustration of a passion shared by Grant, Gavin and Chris. This passion is also shared by many of our customers&mdash;those who buy our knives in appreciation of the design, quality and precision put into our product.""<br><br>&nbsp;This particular knife is the ""Blue Steam"" edition which features an engraved pattern in the titanium as well as a blue sapphire cabochon. Knife is in good condition and shows minor signs of handling/carry. Knife comes in original box with paperwork, birth card (Oct. 21, 2015) leather slip sheath, decal, Loctite, grease, and allen tools.","Reeve, Chris","","","","/TI_Lock___Blue_Steam_180281_1.jpg","3.25""","7.25""","3.4 oz","Previously Owned","S35VN","Drop Point","Metallic, Stones & Minerals","Tactical"

As such, the TM1 is outfitted with a reversible pocket clip for tip-up carry. Closer inspection of the pocket clip will reveal a tungsten carbide glass breaker for use in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Another first for LionSteel is the IKBS ball-bearing pivot, which adds to the refinement of this special folder by ensuring top-notch action and performance.

"180480","Breeden Captain","$125.00","<p>All eyes were on knife designer Jason Breeden's knives at a recent knife show;drawn to his folder with a blade shape unlike anything knife enthusiasts had seen before. The lower half of the blade was curved like a Hawkbill blade but its bulb-like tip was perched on top the curved portion, almost like a head on a neck. When someone asked the designer he replied, ""My designs are born from need I've experienced. I live in the Appalachian Mountains and am regularly outdoors or in water. A recurve blade has cutting advantages in water but I also wanted a strong tip for outdoor applications.""</p>
<p>Spyderco included a Round Hole resulting in the Spyderco/Jason Breeden Captain. The blade's unusual shape creates two opposing cutting angles, one curving inward, one out. The inward curve holds what you're cutting in contact with the sharp edge, ideal for downward pulling cuts and for cutting rope and line. The outward curved cutting edge bulges out at the blade's tip for close-in controlled cutting- a motion used when skinning, whittling and slicing horizontally in a wrist sweeping motion.</p>
<p>The blade is PlainEdge hollow-ground VG-10 with a weight reducing spine swedge. Its G-10 handle has a Walker LinerLock and two full-length steel liners tucked inside for rigidity and strength. Angularly shaped, the handle is comfortable in different grip positions and has a black steel pocket clip designed for 4-way ambidextrous carry. Its appearance is unusual but the overall design defines ergonomics and versatility indoors and out.<br><br>Excellent condition.</p>","Spyderco","","","","/Breeden_Captain_180480_1.jpg","3.0""","7.125""","4.4 oz","Previously Owned","VG-10","Recurve, Tanto, Clip Point","G10","Tactical"

It uses a virtually indestructible light emitting diode (LED) to provide six output levels, from a long-running low beam suitable for map reading, to a brilliant tactical-level high beam with five times the light of a big two-D-cell flashlight. The U2's selector ring provides instant output control, and electronic current regulation maintains a more consistent level of light output for the useable life of the batteries. At the high setting the U2 will put out two hours of tactical level light (50+ lumens from an LED source) with a total runtime of three hours. At the lowest setting it will run for 175 hours. The combination of features in the U2&mdash;compact size, extended runtime and high output capabilities, along with the 10-year shelf life of 123A batteries&mdash;make it perfect for backpacking, camping, or disaster preparedness kits.

Designed for tactical, duty, or general use, the variable-output SureFire U2 Ultra LED flashlight fits conveniently in the palm of your hand, yet is more versatile than lights several times its size. The U2 Ultra is outfitted with a virtually indestructible light emitting diode (LED) with six selectable output levels. The levels include a long-running low beam that's suitable for reading maps, a brilliant tactical level high beam that's five times as intense as a large two D-cell flashlight, and four settings in between. The multiple output levels make this flashlight great for backpacking, camping, or disaster preparedness kits. In addition, the light runs for up to three hours at high output (50-plus lumens) and 175 hours at low output, so you needn't worry about the light failing at the worst possible moment.
<p>The U2 Ultra is also built to last, with a rugged, aerospace-grade aluminum body that's Mil-Spec Type III hard anodized in black. The LED light source, meanwhile, has no filament to burn out or break, helping it last for thousands of hours. And to keep dust and the elements from penetrating the interior, the light is O-ring sealed and weatherproof. Other features include a tempered Pyrex window, an easy-to-use tailcap switch, a heavy-duty pocket clip, and a switch lockout that prevents accidental activation during transport or storage. The U2 Ultra, which includes batteries with a 10-year shelf life, carries a lifetime warranty.</p>

<strong>About SureFire</strong><br>The SureFire story begins in 1969, when Dr. John Matthews--an engineer with a Ph.D. from Cal Tech--founded the Newport Corporation in order to harness the power of the laser for industrial applications. Over time, Matthews turned his inventive mind toward shooting (his hobby and passion), hoping to adapt lasers as firearm sights. He eventually designed and patented a laser sight in 1979, and subsequently bought the laser sight business from the Newport board in order to focus exclusively on commercializing the product. The newly formed Laser Products debuted with a handgun sight for the Colt Trooper, following it up with a sight for a Ruger Mini-14.
<p>In 1984, the business took a huge leap forward with a phone call from the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT Team, which wanted to borrow a number of laser-sighted shotguns for security during the 1984 Olympic Games. In the years that followed, the technically superb, yet seriously expensive, laser-sighted firearms paved the way for future developments, including a weapon-mounted flashlight called the SureFire WeaponLight. Laser Products went on to establish itself as the leading manufacturer of rugged, powerful, and compact illumination tools for tactical applications--from weapon-mounted lights and laser sights to handheld lights powerful and bright enough to qualify as ""force-option"" tools that could temporarily blind, unbalance, and disorient a threat. Eventually, the SureFire moniker became so synonymous with excellence in handheld illumination tools that the company changed its name to SureFire LLC.</p>","SureFire","","","","/U2_Ultra_180496_1.jpg","","6.0""","","","","","",""

<p>The extreme power and portability of the American Made LensLight Mini make this a must have device;emitting an astonishing 7200-LUX (300 Lumens at LED) of power in the highest of two modes, it is untouchable by any competition. With an effective range of over 200 yards, machined aluminum aerospace grade alloy body and weatherproof design, this survival tool is sure to get the job done in the harshest of environments.</p>
<p><strong>1) High Impact Hardened Optical Glass Lenses &ndash;</strong> protects the LED from the toughest of conditions and diligently bends the light much like a magnifying glass to ensure maximum brightness, distance, and efficiency. But don&rsquo;t let the durability of a glass lens fool you, these lenses have been vigorously tested and designed to withstand excessive abuse while retaining optimal performance.</p>
<p><strong>2) Patented Focusing Aspherical Lens System &ndash;</strong> This patented technology allows for a significant array of focusing options ranging from a flood to spot beam. This ensures that the perfect focus setting is available whether you are concentrating the light hundreds of yards away, or simply lighting up an object nearby.</p>
<p><strong>3) 7075 Aluminum Aerospace Grade Alloy Construction&ndash;</strong> Defends against the harshest conditions imaginable and is shielded by a type III hard-anodized finish, a military grade coating available to resists corrosion and improve durability. (Available in either Dark Earth, or Black finish)</p>
<p><strong>4) McClicky Momentary Activation On/Off Switch &ndash;</strong> This reliable easy to use tailcap switch enables the LensLight Mini&rsquo;s 2-stage microprocessor to power the flashlight at either an efficient low setting or high output level for maximum brightness. Simply press down once for low setting, press again for high setting, or simply press all the way down for constant- on.</p>
<p><strong>5) Light Emitting Diode &ndash;</strong>A premium exclusive high-tech, high-efficiency LED is used to emit astonishing power that is untouchable by any other light. This everlasting LED is sure to exert enough luminosity to stop any and everything in its track. Now that&rsquo;s what you call an LED!</p>
<p><strong>6) Premium Grade O-Rings-</strong> LensLight Mini contains 6 strategically placed O-rings throughout the flashlight to seal and protect the lights internals from dust, moisture, and any other micro-substance that it may come in contact with. This ensures that the LensLight performs at maximum efficiency at all times and your investment last a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>7) 1X CR123 Battery &ndash;</strong> powered using only one 123 A battery.</p>
<p><strong>8) Delrin Pocket Clip</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advantages of the DELRIN pocket clip:</strong></p>
<p>-Better memory characteristics to ensure the clip returns to the natural position rather than bending<br> - Delrin Polymer clip does not eat up clothing or scratch up car doors<br> -Low friction for ease of focusablity<br> -Rugged and high strength <br> -Designed to be reversible or removable, and attach securely to molle.</p>

This pen also has the same longitudinal grooves in the middle portion of the body as the Extreme Duty pen. So even though this pen is shorter and smaller in diameter you can still get a very good grip on it when striking!<br><br>This model like all our others is also a MODULAR pen. The small bullet on the back of the pen is a separate threaded piece, meaning that we will be adding all of the other attachments such as the warhead, strike bezel, etc.""<br><br>Features:

Designed and manufactured using state of the art CNC and CAD_CAM technology.
Properly placed traction grooves give a good firm grip when using pen in a CQB mode.

Course threads used throughout for extra thread height which translates into a very strong tough thread able to take the punishment of hard strikes.

The carry options with the Tek-Lok is left or right handed vertical, horizontal, or at 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Made from 5/32"" O-1 tool steel, with a 3"" edge. The main and top chisel ground bevels are hollow ground, with a flat ground front edge.
