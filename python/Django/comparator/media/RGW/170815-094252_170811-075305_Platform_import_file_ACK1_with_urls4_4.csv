<p>&nbsp;Details like our .27&rdquo;titanium back-spacer, which we mill in-house, to our specifications, then drill and tap by hand, combine the inherent strength of the traditional back-spacer with the openness of standoffs. But, going them both one better with the strength of .27&rdquo;titanium and a completely open back to make cleaning simply a matter of running any water or air source through the knife.</p>
<p>Our &frac14;&rdquo;S30V blades, used both on our modified spear point, and our tanto, combines what many believe is the strongest knife steel on the market today, with grinds that give you an unusually sharp edge, in designs built for hard use.</p>
<p>We have jimped our blades both front and back, and also jimped our back-spacer on both sides, so that you have positive grip surfaces in any type of hold, and in any type of conditions. Wet hands, muddy hands, gloved hands, it won&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Although our blades come with a rough tumbled finish, the area around the pivot is mirror polished for an incredibly smooth action! We use bronze washers with white lithium, because it is a tried and true combination, and we&rsquo;ve found, less susceptible to dirt than bearings.</p>
<p>Our pivot, and both the stop pin and the lanyard pin, we make by hand, on a 1943 lathe. They are all hardened 440 steel. And the stop pin and the lanyard pin are identical. Which basically means that you have a spare stop pin!</p>
<p>Our .080&rdquo;titanium liners are full thickness from top to bottom making them thicker and stronger than many frame-locks, which although they do have thicker sections, are milled or relieved at some point to a thinner dimension for ease of flexibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If delicate and pretty is what you&rsquo;re looking for, than probably our &lsquo;PIG&rsquo;is not for you. But, please don&rsquo;t give up on us, as we have a three finger Gentleman&rsquo;s knife coming out, probably by the end of August, with a wide variety of beautiful handle slab options.</p>

Comprised of graceful curving lines, the new smaller Persian Folder 75mm is eye-catching with black Micarta handle scales capped by polished stainless bolsters. On the handle a series of finger choils position the hand for complete control over the cutting edge. Its Eastern inspired blade arches into a curving belly and ends in a graceful upswept tip. The 2-15/16"" (75mm) blade is made of high-performance VG-10 steel (hollow-ground) with a prominent hump positioned above the hole as a thumb leveraging spot. The pocket clip positions the folder to carry right-handed tip-up. A small portion of steel removed from the locking lever offers additional lock safety and is called a David Boye Dent. It permits tightly gripping the handle without grasping with enough force to inadvertently disengaging the lock during use."" <br><br>Includes original packaging or paperwork.

"150527","RMJ Jenny Wren TAD Edition","$550.00","<p><em>Jenny Wren</em> is the traditional name for a small, brownish-grey bird found in the Northern hemisphere. Its covert colors help it to disappear into its surroundings and its highly adaptive nature makes it a tenacious creature in new environments. These characteristics spawned the namesake for RMJ&rsquo;s Jenny Wren - a no-nonsense hawk that is a lightweight and compact field tool with a wickedly aggressive profile. Developed to meet the requirements of a fixed blade knife in weight while retaining the tenacity and psychological advantage of a tomahawk, our RMJ Jenny Wren TAD Edition is a rare opportunity to get your hands on one of these hand crafted masterpieces.</p>
<h5>Features:</h5>
<ul>
The Chrome-Moly 4140 steel construction combined with a skeletonized tang results in a tomahawk that is nearly indestructible.
Exclusively available through Triple Aught Design is the hammer-poll head. Benefitting from the small footprint and low weight of this tool, the user will feel less of a drain on the body and a speed advantage during use and will enjoy the easy accessibility of having an axe and a hammer during camp prep.
Unique in its size, the Jenny Wren is small, but incredibly intimidating psychologically. This advantage makes it useful for situations where carrying a gun for self-defense is not an option.
The bottom eject, jump-ready Kydex scabbard has been updated with a flared opening. This additional flare makes for easy indexing of the blade once your task is complete. The scabbard can be configured as a sling or shoulder strap for easy carry.

<p>The latest variation of our Jenny Wren TAD Edition exhibits field-ready upgrades to include:</p>
<ul>
Shortened beard to allow the user to choke up on the axe for fine detailed work without fear of catching the blade
Extended pinky catch for added stability during aggressive and heavy chopping.","RMJ Tactical","T.A.D. Gear, Inc.","","","/0130505204143723698.jpg","2.625""","12.0""","19.7 oz","","","","",""
